# g930x - Logitech G930 for Linux

This is a fun project I've started, mainly for learning Rust and finally being able to constrol media with the G-keys on my g930 headset.

Currently, it's mainly a POC-in-progress. After I figure most of the things out and get the demo working I'd probably rewrite it as a normal driver, as opposed for the usb sniffing I'm doing right now.
